# Testing

This scoop bucket is currently used for testing purposes and should not be used to get any of this applications.
None of the packages here are stable and most of them may be broken and may warm your system.
This bucket will be ready to use at the same day i launch my new instalation tool to install packages with some package managers.

This bucket will be stable as soon as all the apps (excepting the "-preview" ones) are considered stable

# Scoop Buckets

Scoop buckets are scoop repositories that use json files to set how the downloads and instalations will happen.
If you don't know what is a repository it's basically any local or storage. The type of repository scoop uses is like a software repository used a lot by another package managers, but scoop uses json files to store the download links and the needed scripts to run. Scoop Installs software per user on the user home folder than scoop adds the package folder to the path if needed

# Documentation in Progress

Currently this bucket is not ready for public usage because of multiple scripts, but i'm working on the docs to make it easier to explain. I'll split the information in multiple files so you can get to the point you want easier.

Currently available documents (for now this work like faq's but i'll document this better later):

- [Scoop](docs/scoop.md)
- [Package Manager](docs/package_manager.md)
- [Bucket](docs/bucket.md)
